# Weather App
It is a simple weather application where I have used **OpenWeather API** to get the required data. In the application, You can checkout your city weather  along with temperature of next five days (including the day you have checked your city weather) of same city.

## To use the application 
* Install all the required npm modules (your browser should have node installed).
```bash
$ npm install
```

* Insert your **OpenWeather API** Key in `script.js`.

* Run the gulp
```bash
$ gulp
``` 
* Now use your application ðŸ™‚
